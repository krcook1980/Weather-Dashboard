# Weather-Dashboard
As a traveler, I would like a [weather dashboard](https://krcook1980.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/) to show me the weather for multiple cities.
- Able to search for a city by name.
- Search results include city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and uv index.
-UV index will notify by color if conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
-5 day forecast with date, temperature, weather icon, and humidity will also be displayed.
-Cities I have searched will appear in a search history allowing me to select the city again to view the information.
-When I return to the page, my last searched city information will appear.

## Functionality
Utilized HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and jQuery to create a dynamic webpage that is easy to use. Used ajax to reach the api [OpenWeatherMap.org]("https://openweathermap.org/api") in order to populate the weather information. 

Weather icon as well as background image change based on weather type
